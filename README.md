# Unit-Testing-using-GTest-Framework

This project implements GTest unit testing framework to test newly developed library for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (new algorithm in Lattice cryptography).
The original library was written in C++ and in research phase when this testing code was developed.
The code tests various methods (written for vector operations, integer operations and mathematical operations) for all possible test conditions.
This testing code successfully pointed out any logical, and or compilation errors during the research phase of the algorithm.
The initial test code was primarily developed for Windows platform.
Later a Makefile was developed and incorporated with the original test code for Linux users.

**Note: The step-by-step guidance on how GTest framework is implemented, and how the test methods are decided in the word document included.
